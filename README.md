Based on the awesome [Nord color palette](https://www.nordtheme.com/), Nord for Typora brings the following awesome features:

- A clean soothing experience, with muted colors, providing a calm writing interface.
- A dark theme that is, not too dark, nor ugly. 
- A beautiful interface with proper spacing, muted colors, the perfect amount of contrast, in order to make long writing hours easier.

@ChristosBouronikos has done an outstanding job adapting Typora's colour scheme to the Nord colour palette, but there were some slight font issues, which I fixed.
